Shared Information between Hidden Representations in NMT
========================================================

This repository contains code to measure the amount of shared information between hidden encoder-side representations in neural machine translation models.

Usage
=====

First, train a model according to [documentation for seq2seq-attn](https://github.com/harvardnlp/seq2seq-attn).

1\. Generate a description file
------------------------------

Then invoke `describe.lua` like so:

```
th describe.lua -model XYZ.t7 -src_dict XYZ.src.dict -targ_dict XYZ.targ.dict -src_file XYZ.tok -output_file XYZ.t7
```

`describe.lua` has an additional option specifying the layer to take

```
th describe.lua -model XYZ.t7 -src_dict XYZ.src.dict -targ_dict XYZ.targ.dict -src_file XYZ.tok -output_file XYZ.t7 -enc_layer 1
```

Note: a network with `n` LSTM layers has `2n` hidden layers; each LSTM layer has a memory cell and a hidden cell. Odd layer numbers denote memory cells, and even layer numbers denote the hidden cells, in forward pass order.

All of the options `describe.lua` takes are:

```
-model
-src_dict
-targ_dict
-src_file
-output_file
-enc_layer
```

You will want to generate a description file for each of the models you want to compare. To be compared, description files must be generated on the same `-src_file`.

2\. Generate a comparison table
------------------------------

First, create a text file that contains a list of descriptions for the models you want to compare. It should contain one absolute file location per line, each one pointing to a `t7` file generated by `describe.lua` (specified by the `output_file` option). For instance, you might create `description_list.txt` with:

```
/home/me/desc-1.t7
/home/me/desc-2.t7
/home/me/desc-2.t7
```

which will compares three networks, doing a total of 6 comparisons (networks are not compared with themselves).

Then choose a predictor -- linear (`linear-predictors`), linear with pca (`pca-predictors`), or single-layer MLP (`nonlinear-predictors`). Invoke the corresponding script like so:

```
th pca-predictors -desc_list description_list.txt -out_file comparison_table.json
```

Replacing `pca-predictors` with whichever script you wish to run.

The comparison table will contain the MSE for each dimension for each ordered pair of models, and is written in json format. `-desc_list` and `-out_file` are the only options these scripts accept.

3\. Visualize the comparison table
---------------------------------
